# DDRTLSDR

**Document version:** "beginning of one"

**DDRTLSDR** is a modular, extensible library that provides seamless Python access to RTL-SDR devices through `librtlsdr`. It is designed to simplify and streamline workflows for SDR users, allowing for efficient integration into experimental, research, or production environments. With a focus on modularity and ease of use, DDRTLSDR abstracts low-level SDR operations and provides robust tools for configuration and device management.
